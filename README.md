## Key Ingredients

- **React**: The foundation of our application, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.
- **Redux**: State management to keep the application's data in sync.

## CORS Proxy Server

To power the seamless delivery of delicious dishes through Swiggy's Live API, we've baked in a CORS Proxy Server. This server ensures smooth communication between the application and the API, especially in production. Please note that this might result in a slight delay in the application's responsiveness.
